Find which values of h and SNR maximize the cross-over effect, for an
ideal-observer who knows the true hazard rate.

Fix the number of trials required for each bin. 500 seems reasonable
Fix the bin width. 250 msec seems reasonable
Fix trial duration. 6 seconds seems good
Fix the vector of hazard rate values to test: [0.05,.1,.2,.3,.5] seems good
Fix the vector of SNR values to test. [.5,1,1.5,2] seems good

Generate the trials in advance, to fill up all the bins, for each hazard rate
and SNR condition. Don't store the trial but rather the seed value and the bin 
location.

For each hazard rate, each SNR and each trial, generate a realization of the 
observations, and run the inference algorithm from the ideal-observer on them. 
Store the correctness of the answer and the parameter values. 

Use the above to compute the percentage correct for each bin in each hazard
rate and SNR condition.

Generate cross-over curves for all pairs of hazard rate values, and all SNRs.
