# Simulation report

This report is an answer to [this simulation plan](https://github.com/aernesto/dots-reversal-ideal-obs/blob/abda640a9de98ea32031344dc8a07ef55848933d/simgoals/cross_over.txt).  

The first part of the plan, dealing with generating a database of change point locations, was realized with [this script](https://github.com/aernesto/dots-reversal-ideal-obs/blob/abda640a9de98ea32031344dc8a07ef55848933d/simscripts/gen_trials.py), 
and the resulting database is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k444qi8ws9qaln3/true_1.db?dl=0).
